== Minitest
Minitest is a simple autotester intended to be used with rSpec and rCov.
It can be used with 'plain' ruby projects and Ruby on Rails.

== Installation
=== The easy way
The easy way is to use:
  rake install
This will build the gem and install it for you.

=== The hard way
Alternatively, you can do everything yourself. 
This allows you to fine-tune the gem installation.

Use rake to build the gem:
  rake gem
Then install it:
  sudo gem install -l pkg/minitest-<version>.gem

== Usage
Minitest has the following command line options:
recent::   Only specs for files modified within the last hour are executed on the first run.
profile::  Force rspec output format to 'profile', combined with coloured output and unified diffs.
