== Version 0.1.3
 * The rspec path is no longer hard-coded, but determined using 'which'. The same goes for rcov.
== Version 0.1.2
 * Added 'profile' option. This will ignore the spec.opts file and force the output to be formatted using 'profile' and also have colour and unified diffs.
== Version 0.1.1
 * Fixed bug in first run which would forget to load specs for changed files, but run those files as specs themselves.
 * Fixed bug where the first run ran without 'recent' option would not properly mapfiles to specs.
== Version 0.1
 * Rebuilt quick 'n dirty script into a cleaner class
 * Created gemspec
 * Added a bare minimum of documentation
 * Licensed gem under the MIT license
